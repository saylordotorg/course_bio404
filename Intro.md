Cancer has existed among humans since humans themselves began and has
been a subject of urgent interest from very early in our history.  What
we call “cancer” consists of a number of different diseases with one
fundamental similarity: they are all initiated by the unchecked
proliferation and growth of cells in which the pathways and systems that
normally control cell division and mortality are absent.  Cancer-cell
abnormalities are often due to mutations of the genes that control the
cell cycle and cell growth.  To understand cancer cells, then, one must
first understand the processes that regulate normal cell cycles. This
course will cover the origins of cancer and the genetic and cellular
basis for cancer.  It will examine the factors that have been implicated
in triggering cancers; the intercellular interactions involved in cancer
proliferation; current treatments for cancer and how these are designed;
and future research and treatment directions for cancer therapy.

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:

-   Explain how the perception of cancer and theories of its causes have
    changed throughout history because of important discoveries made by
    scientists, researchers, and physicians.
-   Summarize the importance of understanding cell biology in the study
    of cancer, its causes, it progression, and its treatment.
-   Outline the transcription and translation processes used to convert
    DNA into proteins and what changes occur that convert
    proto-oncogenes into oncogenes and lead to unchecked cell growth and
    cancer.
-   Compare and contrast the mechanisms by which activation of
    oncogenes, loss of tumor suppressors, loss of cell cycle
    checkpoints, and development of faulty DNA repair lead to cancer.
-   Describe the various cancer prevention mechanisms including risk
    assessment, screening, and lifestyle and environmental
    modification.  
-   List the past, current, and future cancer treatments and the
    mechanism by which these target cancer causing cells.

### Course Requirements

In order to take this course, you must:  
  
 √    Have access to a computer.  
  
 √    Have continuous broadband internet access.  
  
 √    Have the ability/permission to install plug-ins or software (e.g.
Adobe Reader or Flash).  
  
 √    Have the ability to download and save files and documents to a
computer.  
  
 √    Have the ability to open Microsoft files and documents (.doc,
.ppt, .xls, etc.).  
  
 √    Be competent in the English language.

√    Have read the [Saylor Student
Handbook.](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Saylor-StudentHandbook.pdf)

√    Have completed [BIO101](http://www.saylor.org/courses/bio101/) and
[BIO102](http://www.saylor.org/majors/biology/) from “[The Core
Program](http://www.saylor.org/majors/biology/)” in the Biology
discipline.

### Course Information

**Welcome to BIO404!  **Below, please find some general information
about the course and its requirements.

**Course Designer**: Amy L. Thompson, PhD, MLS (ASCP)

**Primary Resources**: This course is comprised of a range of different
free, online materials.  However, the course makes primary use of the
following materials:

-   American Cancer Society’s “[The History of
    Cancer](http://www.cancer.org/Cancer/CancerBasics/TheHistoryofCancer/the-history-of-cancer-what-is-cancer)”
-   National Cancer Institute’s “[Understanding Cancer
    Series”](http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/understandingcancer/cancer)
-   Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory’s [Inside
    Cancer](http://www.insidecancer.org/)
-   Emory University’s [Cancer Quest](http://www.cancerquest.org/)

**Requirements for Completion: **In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials. 
Pay special attention to Units 1 and 2 as these lay the groundwork for
understanding the more, exploratory material presented in latter units. 
You will also need to complete:

-   Unit 1.2.1 Assessment
-   Unit 2.2.1 Assignment
-   Unit 2.2.6 Assignment
-   Unit 3.2.4 Assessment
-   Unit 3.3.2.2 Assignment
-   Unit 4.3.1 Assessment
-   Unit 5.2.5 Assessment
-   Unit 7.1 Assignment
-   Unit 8.2.7 Assessment
-   The Final Exam

Note that you will only receive an official grade on your final exam. 
However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
work through the assessments and assignments listed above.

In order to pass this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher on
the Final Exam.  Your score will be tabulated as soon as you complete
it.  If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.

**Time Commitment: **This course should take you a total of **95 hours**
to complete.  Each unit contains a “time advisory” that lists the amount
of time that you are expected to spend on each subunit.  These should
help you plan your time accordingly.  It may be useful to take a look at
these time advisories and to determine how much time you have over the
next few weeks to complete each unit, and then set goals for yourself. 
Use the time advisories to help you plot out your schedule of when you
do each unit/subunit and on which days of the week.  For example, Unit 1
should take you 10.5 hours to complete. Perhaps you can sit down with
your calendar and decide to complete subunits 1.1 (a total of 1.5 hours)
on Monday night; subunit 1.2.1 and 1.2.2 (a total of 2.25 hours) on
Tuesday night; etc.

**Tips/Suggestions: **The material in this course builds on the earlier
material.  You must have a good understanding of the cell cycle, DNA
replication, transcription, and translation in order to understand how
cancer develops.  If you have difficulty grasping these early concepts,
the later units will be very difficult.  It is important that you take
notes for all readings, lectures, and learning tasks.  When available,
you may choose to print out articles and take notes directly on them. 
You may want to use the course units and their subunits to create an
outline for your notes.
