**Unit 1: Origins and Overview** <span id="1"></span> 
**This unit will introduce you to the history of cancer.  Many notable
scientists have made important discoveries about the causes of cancer,
its progression, and potential therapies.  You will learn about how our
understanding of cancer has evolved throughout history from early
beliefs that cancer was contagious leading to isolation to the more
modern approach of targeting the genes that cause cancer.  In subunit
1.2, you will get an overview of what happens to cells leading to
cancer, causative agents, and basic information about the spread of this
disease.  Following units will go into more detail about this
information.  **
