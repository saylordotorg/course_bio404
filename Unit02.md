**Unit 2: Gene Expression and Regulation** <span id="2"></span> 
**To understand how cancer is disruptive, you must first understand the
systems it disrupts.  This unit will cover the primary means through
which DNA and gene expression are regulated within the cell, focusing on
the pathways and genes which, when mutated, can lead to unchecked cell
growth.  This unit will be concerned with the genes that are normally
involved in cell growth and division (called proto-oncogenes).  When
these genes are “activated” in one of several ways, they no longer cause
cells to divide normally but instead trigger unchecked cell division and
proliferation; when this occurs, these genes are referred to as
“oncogenes.”**

**Unit2 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:
-   Describe the DNA structure and how it is changed in cancer.
-   List the steps in the transcription and translation processes,
    identifying the important factors for each step, including
    transcription factors.
-   Explain how alkylating agents, intercalating agents, and radiation
    can lead to various types of mutations in DNA and the mechanisms
    that repair these.
-   Trace the steps of signal transduction and the amplification of the
    first messenger ligand signal to second messenger production,
    kinase/phosphatase activation, and overall effect.
-   Outline the role of proto-oncogenes and their conversion to
    oncogenes and in the development of cancer.
