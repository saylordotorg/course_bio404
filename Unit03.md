**Unit 3: Growth Inhibitors** <span id="3"></span> 
**In normal cells, there are factors that check cell growth, prevent or
slow cell division, and trigger apoptosis (programmed cell death) of
specific cells.  If these genes are defective, their inability to
control these processes of the normal cell cycle can also lead to
cancer.  This unit will cover the processes of the typical cell cycle
and its checkpoints and will examine the genes and proteins whose loss
of function can lead to cell division without restraints.**

**Unit3 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:
-   Describe the cell cycle, including the checkpoints that prevent
    uncontrolled cell growth and development.
-   Give examples of tumor suppressors, and explain how their
    de-activation leads to cancer.
-   Compare and contrast the mechanisms by which oncogenes, loss of
    tumor suppressors, and faulty DNA repair cause cancer.

     Instructions: This module does a great job reviewing all of the
    steps of the cell cycle and relating it to cancer and cancer
    treatment.  Start with the introduction and work your way through
    the summary.  Click on next to move to subsequent pages, and click
    on the tab to the left to go to the next section.  Make sure to view
    the animations that are found throughout this module.  Focus on the
    different phases of the cell cycle and the ways that deviation from
    these normal phases might lead to cancer.

    classifies it as a tumor suppressor.  Cold Stream Harbor Laboratory
    presents this animation of how transcription factor and tumor
    suppressor p53 regulates the cell cycle allowing for DNA repair.
