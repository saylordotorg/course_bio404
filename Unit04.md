**Unit 4: Death and Life: Apoptosis and Immortality** <span
id="4"></span> 
**The process through which cells that are defective, old, or no longer
necessary are programmed to die is a tremendously important one. 
Apoptosis (programmed cell death) occurs in embryos going through
complex cell movements and rearrangements and in adults going through
the normal cycle of cell metabolism.  This process of dying is altered
in cancer cells, as are the processes that limit the number of times a
cell can proliferate, leading to what can be described as an “immortal”
cell.  Such a cell is no longer responsive to “suicide” cues and no
longer capable of undergoing replicative senescence (the cessation of
division).  The result of this unstoppable cell’s proliferation is the
development of a tumor.**

**Unit4 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:
-   Describe the process of apoptosis, including the role of death
    receptors and its role in cancer.

    cancer.

    Lacks have had on the medical and scientific community.
-   List the steps in the tumor development.

    first immortalized cell line, known as HeLa cells, taken from
    African-American Henrietta Lacks.  Author Rebecca Skloot, who wrote
    the book *The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks*, thoroughly
    discusses Henrietta and her immortal cervical cells in this
    interview.  Johns Hopkins took these cells from Henrietta Lacks
    without her knowledge or consent.  HeLa cells have been one of the
    greatest tools in research leading to numerous medical and
    scientific discoveries.
