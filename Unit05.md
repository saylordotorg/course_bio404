**Unit 5: Intercellular Interactions and Invasions** <span
id="5"></span> 
**In order for cancer cells to spread throughout the body, they must not
only proliferate but also interact with each other and other cell
types.  Once cancer cells begin to proliferate, a cluster of cells forms
and eventually reaches a size at which the cells can no longer acquire
the oxygen and nutrients they need through diffusion.  Like normal
tissues, they need a blood supply and are therefore able to secrete
factors that trigger normal cells to form new blood vessels.  This
process is called angiogenesis and is thought to be first condition
necessary for metastasis (cancer spread and invasion).*  
 *Once tumors are able to proliferate, some portion of them must be able
to detach from the original tumor, spread through the body, and “invade”
other tissues.  Changes in the level of cell adhesion (the loosening of
cells from their connections to one another) are often associated with
an increased ability of cancer cells to spread.  Proteolysis, the
selective degradation of portions of other cell membranes, is also a
necessary precondition for the invasion of tissue by cancer cells.**

**Unit5 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:
-   Describe how the process of angiogenesis promotes the survival and
    spread of cancer cells.
-   List the common inducers and inhibitors of angiogenesis and how
    these are used in targeted therapy.
-   Outline the steps leading to metastasis and three ways that cancer
    spreads to other areas of the body
-   Identify the common sites that cancer spreads in various types of
    cancer.
