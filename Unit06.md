**Unit 6: Carcinogens** <span id="6"></span> 
**While mutations and genetic predispositions can lead to cancer,
environmental factors have been shown to do so as well.  These factors
have various means of triggering cancer-cell development and
proliferation.  The likelihood of developing cancer from exposure to
carcinogens depends on a number of conditions, including the potency of
the carcinogen, the intensity of exposure, the duration of exposure, and
predisposition or genetic sensitivity to the carcinogen.**

**Unit6 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:
-   Identify the common types of physical, chemical, parasitic, and
    radiation carcinogens.

     Instructions:  Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory offers this four
    module series called Inside Cancer.  This module covers some of the
    same carcinogens covered by the National Cancer Institute but also
    covers some new carcinogens.  This source offers a more in depth
    look at many of these.  We will focus on the module called “Causes
    and Prevention” to further examine what is understood about
    different cancer causing agents or carcinogens.  Click on Causes and
    Prevention.  There are seven sections in this module.  Start with
    the Overview and work your way through the other six sections:
    Smoking, Inheritance, Diet, Mold, Viruses, and Sunlight.  For each
    section, you will need to click the arrow to move to the next step
    in the animation.  You will also want to click on the arrows next to
    the words on each slide to view more information about the factors
    listed.
