**Unit 7: Cancer Therapy: Past, Present, and Future** <span
id="7"></span> 
**Numerous factors lead to the development of cancer in cells throughout
the body.  By understanding their risk, patients can take proactive
steps to help prevent the development of cancer.  A large number of
cancer screening methods are used to detect cancer including blood
antigens, fecal occult blood, and colonoscopy, among others.  With risk
assessment and screening, can potentially be detected early and
prognosis is improved.**
