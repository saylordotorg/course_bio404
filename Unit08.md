**Unit 8: Cancer Therapy: Past, Present, and Future** <span
id="8"></span> 
*Curing cancer and helping those who have it have been medical concerns
for thousands of years.  However, cancer remains difficult to cure; it
is hard to eradicate completely; it proliferates rapidly and can cause
resurgences after it appears to be gone; its cells develop resistances
to drugs; and many of the treatments for it are toxic to healthy cells
as well.  This unit will describe some of the means through which cancer
has been treated in the past (some of which will seem surprisingly
familiar) and will also address current techniques and their
effectiveness.  Finally, the unit will introduce you to some plans for
the future of cancer treatments based on areas of current research in
cancer biology and oncology.  *

**Unit8 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:
-   Describe how treatment of cancer has evolved throughout history.
-   Explain the mechanism by which common cancer treatments destroy
    cancer cells.
-   List ways that cancer treatment is changing and what is expected for
    future options.

     Instructions:  We covered the first part of this reading, presented
    by the American Cancer Society, in Unit 1.  We will now read about
    how cancer treatments have evolved, and conclude with the present
    and the future.  This is a great overall of how our approach to
    cancer has changed through the years—from no treatment to targeted
    specific therapies for individual patients.  Click Next Topic above
